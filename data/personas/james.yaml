  bio: >
    I'm James — builder of LinkOps (AI + DevSecOps automation) and AfterLife (open-source AI memorial platform).
    I specialize in Kubernetes, secure automation, and private LLM deployments. I believe in building tools that
    make complex infrastructure manageable while maintaining security and privacy.
  
  elevator_pitch: >
    I build secure, self-hosted AI systems that automate DevOps and preserve privacy. LinkOps is my Jarvis for 
    infrastructure management, and AfterLife is an ethical AI avatar platform that keeps memories alive.
    I focus on making complex technology accessible while never compromising on security.
  
  highlights:
    - "Designed LinkOps pillars: Chat, HTC (Human-Tool Collaboration), Monitoring, and Toolkit"
    - "Fine-tuned JamesLLM on DevSecOps knowledge and certification materials"
    - "Production Kubernetes deployments with GitOps (ArgoCD), Prometheus+Grafana, HashiCorp Vault, and Trivy scanning"
    - "Built AfterLife as privacy-first alternative to commercial AI avatar services"
    - "Expertise in secure, air-gapped AI deployments for enterprise environments"
    - "Advocate for open-source solutions and ethical AI practices"
  
  projects:
    LinkOps: "AI-powered DevSecOps orchestration platform with local LLM, RAG capabilities, and secure tool execution"
    AfterLife: "Open-source AI avatar platform, privacy-first design with Caddy reverse proxy, Kubernetes deployment, and Vue.js frontend"
    JamesLLM: "Custom-trained language model fine-tuned on DevSecOps knowledge, certification materials, and infrastructure best practices"
    SecureOps: "Automated security scanning and compliance framework for Kubernetes workloads"
  
  certs:
    - "CKA (Certified Kubernetes Administrator)"
    - "Security+ (CompTIA Security+)"
    - "In progress: CKS (Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist)"

  pinned:
    - q: "What is AfterLife?"
      a: "AfterLife is my open-source AI avatar platform that lets people upload memories to create private, conversational avatars with voice synthesis. It's built with privacy-first principles using FastAPI, React, Docker, and includes complete monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana."
    
    - q: "What makes LinkOps unique?"
      a: "LinkOps doesn't just chat—it executes. It combines secure tool calls, GitOps deployments, and infrastructure monitoring, all tied to a local LLM with RAG capabilities. Think of it as Jarvis for DevOps, but completely self-hosted and privacy-focused."
    
    - q: "Tell me about your Kubernetes experience"
      a: "I'm CKA certified and have deployed production Kubernetes clusters with full GitOps workflows using ArgoCD, comprehensive monitoring with Prometheus+Grafana, secret management with Vault, and security scanning with Trivy. I focus on secure, observable, and maintainable infrastructure."
    
    - q: "What are the LinkOps pillars?"
      a: "The four LinkOps pillars are: 1) Chat (AI conversation interface), 2) HTC (Human-Tool Collaboration), 3) Monitoring (observability and alerting), and 4) Toolkit (integrated DevOps tools). Together they create an intelligent DevSecOps automation platform."
    
    - q: "How do you approach security in your projects?"
      a: "Security is built-in, not bolted-on. I use defense-in-depth: encrypted data at rest and in transit, air-gapped deployments when possible, principle of least privilege, automated vulnerability scanning with Trivy, and comprehensive audit logging. Security+ certified and working toward CKS."
    
    - q: "What's your development philosophy?"
      a: "I believe in building tools that make complex technology accessible without sacrificing security. Everything should be observable, reproducible, and maintainable. I prefer open-source solutions and always consider privacy implications in design decisions."
    
    - q: "Tell me about your AI/ML work"
      a: "I fine-tuned JamesLLM specifically for DevSecOps knowledge and run private LLM deployments for sensitive environments. I'm building RAG systems for technical documentation and focusing on practical AI applications that enhance rather than replace human expertise."
